## Common Workflows

### First Time Setup

```bash
make quick-start
# This runs: env + up + migrate + user
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Morning
make up
make logs

# Code changes
make test

# End of day
make down
```

### Database Changes

```bash
# Create migration
make migrate-create MSG="add new field"

# Apply migration
make migrate

# Rollback if needed
make migrate-down
```

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Quick test
make test

# With coverage
make test-cov

# Watch mode
make test-watch
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check linting
make lint

# Type checking
make type-check

# All checks
make check
```

### Debugging

```bash
# View logs
make logs

# API logs only
make logs-api

# Open shell
make shell

# Check health
make health
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy
make deploy-prod

# Or manual steps
make build
make up
make migrate
make user
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Clean Python cache
make clean

# Remove Docker volumes
make clean-docker

# Full cleanup
make clean-all
```

## Tips

1. **Tab completion**: Most terminals support tab completion for make targets
2. **Parallel logs**: Use `make logs` then Ctrl+C to stop
3. **Specific service logs**: `make logs ARGS="api"`
4. **Custom commands**: Edit Makefile to add your own commands
5. **Help anytime**: Run `make help` to see all commands

## Environment Variables

Some commands use environment variables:

```bash
# Migration message
make migrate-create MSG="your message"

# Backup file
make db-restore FILE="backup.sql"

# Docker tag
make docker-push TAG="v1.0.0"

# Specific service logs
make logs ARGS="postgres"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found
Make sure you're in the project root directory.

### Permission denied
Run with appropriate permissions or check Docker permissions.

### Service not starting
Check logs with `make logs` and verify .env configuration.

### Database connection error
Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `make ps`
