git clone https://github.com/dny1020/api-contact-center.git
cd api-contact-center

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
vim .env  # Update all values

# Start database
docker-compose up -d postgres
sleep 10

# Run migrations
docker-compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head

# Create admin user
docker-compose run --rm api python -m app.auth.create_user

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify deployment
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health
```
